# Data-mining-techniques-on-astronomical-spectra-data.-II-Classification-Analysis
Classification alagorithms and features extraction methods on astronomiacal spectra.

In this paper, we investigate the classification methods used for astronomical spectra data. We introduce the main ideas, advantages, caveats, and applications of classification methods. And data sets are
designed by data characteristics, data qualities, and data volumes.
Besides, we experiment with nine basic algorithms(KNN, SVM, LR,
PIL, CNN, DT, RF, GBDT, XGBoost) on A/F/G/K stars classification, star/galaxy/quasar classification, and rare object identification.
Experiments on data characteristics also include the comparative
experiments on the matching sources from the LAMOST survey and
SDSS survey
